# Golang Ping Monitor Service

A Go-based service that monitors IP addresses and sends email notifications when they become unreachable.

## Features

- **Ping Monitoring**: Continuously pings configured IP addresses at specified intervals
- **Email Notifications**: Sends alerts when targets go down or come back up
- **Configurable**: JSON-based configuration for targets, intervals, and email settings
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals properly
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of ping results and notifications

## Email Service: Brevo (Recommended)

This service uses [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) (formerly Sendinblue) for reliable email delivery:

### **Why Brevo?**
- âœ… **Free Tier**: 300 emails/day, 9,000 emails/month
- âœ… **High Deliverability**: Excellent reputation for inbox delivery
- âœ… **Easy Setup**: Simple API key authentication
- âœ… **Reliable**: Enterprise-grade email infrastructure
- âœ… **No SMTP Complexity**: Direct API integration

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 2. Setup Brevo Account

1. **Create Brevo Account**:
   - Go to [brevo.com](https://www.brevo.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Verify your email address

2. **Get API Key**:
   - Login to your Brevo dashboard
   - Go to **Settings** â†’ **API Keys**
   - Click **Create a new API key**
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Ping Monitor")
   - Copy the generated API key

3. **Configure Email Settings**:
   ```json
   {
     "email": {
       "api_key": "your-brevo-api-key-here",
       "from": "monitor@yourdomain.com",
       "to": "admin@yourcompany.com"
     }
   }
   ```

### 3. Domain Verification (Optional but Recommended)

For better deliverability, verify your sending domain:

1. In Brevo dashboard, go to **Senders & IP** â†’ **Domains**
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Follow the DNS verification steps
4. Update the `from` email in config.json to use your verified domain

### 4. Configure Targets

Edit `config.json` to add your monitoring targets:

```json
{
  "ping_interval_seconds": 30,
  "ping_count": 3,
  "ping_time_threshold_ms": 200,
  "email": {
    "api_key": "your-brevo-api-key",
    "from": "monitor@yourdomain.com",
    "to": "admin@yourcompany.com"
  },
  "targets": [
    {
      "name": "Google DNS",
      "target": "8.8.8.8"
    },
    {
      "name": "Cloudflare DNS", 
      "target": "1.1.1.1"
    },
    {
      "name": "Local Router",
      "target": "192.168.1.1"
    },
    {
      "name": "Example Domain",
      "target": "example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission denied for ping**: The service uses unprivileged ping by default. If you need privileged ping, modify the `SetPrivileged(true)` in the code.

2. **Email not sending**: 
   - Verify Brevo API key is correct
   - Check that sender email is verified in Brevo
   - Ensure API key has proper permissions

3. **Targets not responding**:
   - Verify IP addresses or domain names are correct
   - Check network connectivity and DNS resolution
   - Ensure targets allow ICMP packets

### Testing

Test individual targets:
```bash
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
```

Test Brevo configuration:
```bash
# Test your Brevo API key
curl -X POST "https://api.brevo.com/v3/smtp/email" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sender": {"name": "Test", "email": "test@yourdomain.com"},
    "to": [{"email": "admin@yourdomain.com"}],
    "subject": "Test Email",
    "textContent": "This is a test email from Brevo"
  }'
```

## Security Considerations

- Store Brevo API key securely (use environment variables in production)
- Use a dedicated monitoring email account
- Implement proper firewall rules for the monitoring server
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive configuration:
  ```bash
  export BREVO_API_KEY="your-api-key"
  # Then update config.json to use: "api_key": "$BREVO_API_KEY"
  ```

## Installation Scripts

The project includes automated installation scripts for CentOS Stream 9:

#### **Install Script (`install.sh`)**
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

**What the install script does:**
- âœ… Installs Go if not present
- âœ… Creates dedicated service user (`pingmon`)
- âœ… Copies files to `/opt/ping-monitor`
- âœ… Builds the service binary
- âœ… Creates systemd service file
- âœ… Enables and starts the service
- âœ… Sets up proper security and resource limits

#### **Uninstall Script (`uninstall.sh`)**
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

**What the uninstall script does:**
- âœ… Stops and disables the service
- âœ… Removes systemd service file
- âœ… Removes installation directory
- âœ… Removes service user
- âœ… Cleans up log files

### **Service Management Commands**

After installation, use these commands to manage the service:

```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl start ping-monitor

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop ping-monitor

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart ping-monitor

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status ping-monitor

# View real-time logs
sudo journalctl -u ping-monitor -f

# View recent logs
sudo journalctl -u ping-monitor --since "1 hour ago"

# Enable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl enable ping-monitor

# Disable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl disable ping-monitor
```

### **Configuration After Installation**

After installation, update your configuration:

```bash
# Edit the configuration file
sudo nano /opt/ping-monitor/config.json

# Restart the service after changes
sudo systemctl restart ping-monitor
```

### **Updating the Service**

The `install.sh` script automatically detects existing installations and runs in **UPDATE mode**:

```bash
# Pull the latest code from git
cd /path/to/ping-monitor
git pull

# Run the installer (it will detect the existing installation)
sudo ./install.sh
```

**What happens during an update:**
- âœ… **Stops the service** temporarily
- âœ… **Preserves your config.json** (automatically restored after update)
- âœ… **Updates the binary** with latest code
- âœ… **Updates dependencies** (go.mod, go.sum)
- âœ… **Restarts the service** automatically
- âœ… **Verifies service started** successfully

**Configuration management:**
- Your existing `config.json` is **always preserved** during updates
- A one-time backup `config.json.original` is created on first install
- No multiple backup files created (keeps directory clean)

**To restore original configuration:**
```bash
# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop ping-monitor

# Restore from original backup
sudo cp /opt/ping-monitor/config.json.original /opt/ping-monitor/config.json

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl start ping-monitor
```
