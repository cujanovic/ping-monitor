- **Packet Loss Detection**: Alerts when packet loss exceeds configurable thresholds (not just complete failure)
- **Latency Monitoring**: Tracks response times and alerts on high latency
- **Email Notifications**: Sends alerts when targets go down, recover, or experience issues
- **Summary Reports**: Daily or weekly email digests with uptime statistics and performance metrics
- **Config Validation**: Comprehensive validation of configuration on startup
- **Alert Cooldown**: Prevents alert spam with configurable cooldown periods
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects email quota with configurable email rate limits
- **Concurrent Optimization**: Efficient handling of large numbers of targets with worker pool
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues monitoring other targets even if some fail
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Per-target or global timeout settings
- **Flexible Configuration**: Per-target or global thresholds for latency and packet loss
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals properly
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging with statistics and error recovery

## Advanced Features

### Summary Reports
Automatically generates and emails daily or weekly summary reports with:
- Uptime percentage for each target
- Success/failure statistics
- Latency metrics (average, min, max)
- Packet loss statistics
- Count of high latency and packet loss events

Configure with `summary_report_enabled`, `summary_report_schedule` (daily/weekly), and `summary_report_time` (HH:MM format).

### Config Validation
Comprehensive validation on startup checks:
- Required fields are present
- Values are within valid ranges
- Email addresses are properly formatted
- No duplicate target names or addresses
- Thresholds are reasonable
- Prevents common configuration mistakes

### Graceful Degradation
The system continues monitoring all targets even when issues occur:
- If one target fails, others continue unaffected
- Network errors don't stop the service
- Email failures are logged but monitoring continues
- Panic recovery ensures goroutines restart
- Errors are logged with context for troubleshooting

### Configurable Timeouts
Set different timeouts for different targets:
- Fast local networks: 5 seconds
- Regional servers: 10 seconds (default)
- International connections: 15-30 seconds
- Per-target overrides or global default

### Alert Cooldown
Prevents alert spam when targets flap up/down repeatedly. After sending an alert for a specific issue on a target, subsequent alerts for the same issue are suppressed for the cooldown period (default: 15 minutes).

### Email Rate Limiting
Protects your Brevo email quota (300 emails/day on free tier) by limiting emails sent per hour. Uses a sliding window to track recent emails. Alerts are logged even if rate limit is reached.

### Packet Loss Detection
Monitors not just complete failures but also partial packet loss. Perfect for detecting intermittent network issues before they become critical. Configure different thresholds per target.

### Concurrent Optimization
Uses a worker pool pattern to efficiently handle large numbers of targets. The `max_concurrent_pings` setting prevents overwhelming your network or system resources.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Configuration validation errors on startup**:
   - Read the error message carefully - it lists all validation issues
   - Fix each issue in config.json
   - Common issues: invalid email format, out-of-range values, duplicate names

2. **Permission denied for ping**: The service uses unprivileged ping by default. If you need privileged ping, modify the `SetPrivileged(true)` in the code.

3. **Email not sending**: 
   - Verify Brevo API key is correct
   - Check that sender email is verified in Brevo
   - Ensure API key has proper permissions
   - Check if rate limit has been reached (view logs)

4. **Targets not responding**:
   - Verify IP addresses or domain names are correct
   - Check network connectivity and DNS resolution
   - Ensure targets allow ICMP packets
   - Try increasing timeout_seconds for slow connections
   
5. **Too many alerts (spam)**:
   - Increase `alert_cooldown_minutes` (default: 15)
   - Adjust thresholds to be less sensitive
   - Enable summary reports to reduce individual alerts

6. **Hitting email quota**:
   - Reduce `email_rate_limit_per_hour` (default: 60)
   - Increase `alert_cooldown_minutes` to reduce frequency
   - Use summary reports instead of individual alerts
   - Consider upgrading your Brevo plan

7. **Timeouts on specific targets**:
   - Increase `timeout_seconds` for that target
   - Check network path to target
   - Consider if target is appropriate for monitoring

8. **Summary reports not sending**:
   - Verify `summary_report_enabled` is true
   - Check `summary_report_time` format (HH:MM)
   - Ensure `summary_report_schedule` is "daily" or "weekly"
   - Reports send at the configured time

### Testing

Test individual targets:
```bash
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
```

Test Brevo configuration:
```bash
# Test your Brevo API key
curl -X POST "https://api.brevo.com/v3/smtp/email" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sender": {"name": "Test", "email": "test@yourdomain.com"},
    "to": [{"email": "admin@yourdomain.com"}],
    "subject": "Test Email",
    "textContent": "This is a test email from Brevo"
  }'
```

## Security Considerations

- Store Brevo API key securely (use environment variables in production)
- Use a dedicated monitoring email account
- Implement proper firewall rules for the monitoring server
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive configuration:
  ```bash
  export BREVO_API_KEY="your-api-key"
  # Then update config.json to use: "api_key": "$BREVO_API_KEY"
  ```

## Installation Scripts

The project includes automated installation scripts for systemd-based Linux distributions:

#### **Install Script (`install.sh`)**
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

**What the install script does:**
- âœ… Installs Go if not present
- âœ… Creates dedicated service user (`pingmon`)
- âœ… Copies files to `/opt/ping-monitor`
- âœ… Builds the service binary
- âœ… Creates systemd service file
- âœ… Enables and starts the service
- âœ… Sets up proper security and resource limits

#### **Uninstall Script (`uninstall.sh`)**
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

**What the uninstall script does:**
- âœ… Stops and disables the service
- âœ… Removes systemd service file
- âœ… Removes installation directory
- âœ… Removes service user
- âœ… Cleans up log files

### **Service Management Commands**

After installation, use these commands to manage the service:

```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl start ping-monitor

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop ping-monitor

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart ping-monitor

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status ping-monitor

# View real-time logs
sudo journalctl -u ping-monitor -f

# View recent logs
sudo journalctl -u ping-monitor --since "1 hour ago"

# Enable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl enable ping-monitor

# Disable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl disable ping-monitor
```

### **Configuration After Installation**

After installation, update your configuration:

```bash
# Edit the configuration file
sudo nano /opt/ping-monitor/config.json

# Restart the service after changes
sudo systemctl restart ping-monitor
```

### **Updating the Service**

The `install.sh` script automatically detects existing installations and runs in **UPDATE mode**:

```bash
# Pull the latest code from git
cd /path/to/ping-monitor
git pull

# Run the installer (it will detect the existing installation)
sudo ./install.sh
```

**What happens during an update:**
- âœ… **Stops the service** temporarily
- âœ… **Preserves your config.json** (automatically restored after update)
- âœ… **Updates the binary** with latest code
- âœ… **Updates dependencies** (go.mod, go.sum)
- âœ… **Restarts the service** automatically
- âœ… **Verifies service started** successfully

**Configuration management:**
- Your existing `config.json` is **always preserved** during updates
- A one-time backup `config.json.original` is created on first install
- No multiple backup files created (keeps directory clean)

**To restore original configuration:**
```bash
# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop ping-monitor

# Restore from original backup
sudo cp /opt/ping-monitor/config.json.original /opt/ping-monitor/config.json

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl start ping-monitor
```
